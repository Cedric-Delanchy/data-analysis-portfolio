# Data analysis portfolio *(Work in progress)*

## About Me ##

Hi there, I'm Cedric ! Welcome to my portfolio. My career in digital and as an entrepreuneur has seen me assume critical roles in a variety of contexts & industries, affording me extensive expertise in analytics, digital product development, data and marketing. 

I've realised that analytics was always a part of the roles I've assumed and that it is a domain I wanted to progress in. So I've recently specialized in data to add more tools to my skillset. 

This portfolio is here for two reasons: 
- give me a space where I can centralize my practice in different aspects of data analysis,
- showcase some work I've done in order to continuously craft my knowledges and my skills.

Also, I'm working as a freelance Data Product Manager/Product owner data/Product analyst. So, if you're interested to work with me you can check my [resume in English](https://github.com/Cedric-Delanchy/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/Resume_Cedric-Delanchy_EN.pdf) or [in French](https://github.com/Cedric-Delanchy/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/CV-Cedric_Delanchy.pdf).
